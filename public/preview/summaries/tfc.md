## The Two-Flat Cats

Once upon a time, the human world discovered the toon world—and wasted no time turning it into a playground. Theme parks, factories, even hospitals cashed in on the power of Ink and Paint. For a while, it was fun and games. Then the first kid turned into a toon.

Now, toons are a political nightmare, and the new president wants them gone.

Fenton Fox, a runaway toon with a chip on his shoulder, just wanted a quiet life with his husband, Benny. Valerie Cat is still trying to reconcile her past with her present, now that her best friend—sorry, best _boi_—Ky has transitioned into something new. And then there's Daniel Cobbler, Fenton's estranged father and former Realist talking head, who shows up on their doorstep with nothing but an apology and a death sentence.

With the walls closing in, the toons of Jazztown have a choice: lay low and hope for the best, or do what toons do best—dance in the twilight of their world.

_A riotous, emotionally charged story about community, resilience, and refusing to fade away—even when the world wants you gone._
