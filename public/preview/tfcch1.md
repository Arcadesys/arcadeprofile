# The Two-Flat Cats

# 0.1:

Once upon a time, a drunk freshman painted a hole in the wall and fell into a world where cartoons are real. (No, seriously. That's how this zany mess all started.)

For a decade, humans treated the toon world like a giant playground. Hospitals moved for the cheap real estate and cute, cuddly teddy bear nursing staff. Manufacturers loved the giant bulls who could lift ten times the weight of their human counterparts. Zany toon summer camps, hosted by otters with real personality, became the highlight of many children's summers.

And the paint! In the toon world, paint was the sole element that mattered. With it one could build massive skyscrapers, impossibly tiny parts, and every iteration in between. It even spurred a cosmetic boom: it became the fashion of the day to wear toon bunny ears in theme parks, or to wear a jessica-rabbit dress for a New Years party.

Some businesses even took it further, doing full body paints that changed the very definition of what it meant to be human. Mascots went from fancy furry carpets to detailed, reactive, and strangely human in their design. Then the hobbyists becan experimenting with paint, doing full faces of bunny rabbits or raccoons or whatever for the convention scene. And finally, Halloween stores started selling full toon bodies for Halloween. (Boy howdy, did those fly off the shelves!)

This led to some wild enterprises. Like the barcade that painted every guest into an 8-year-old raccoon to recreate a pizza party vibe. Or the flight school that let you don a winged pegasus suit and soar through the air. If you could imagine it, there was a toon out there who was excited to bring it to life.

And for a while there we were all very, very happy.

Until one day, without warning, a teenager turned into a real-life toon.

They changed in the cities. They changed in the sticks. They changed in the suburbs, the congress. Their fate was not their own; they were kids, after all, and toon paint was a choice everyone made for fun sometimes, even if they never talked about it. It was up to the parents and how they responded.

Some homes chose hope. Some chose abuse. For Fenton Fox, the home was a pressure cooker. He grew up in the suburbs with his brother Tom and loving father Daniel. After a messy divorce, after which his mother Irene turned into a toon, his dad fell deep into the Realist information bubble.

You see, not everyone liked having toons around. So the Realists came up with a treatment - Realization - to turn toons back into real human beings. Did it work? Who knows? They never published their findings on the procedure.

But anyway, Fenton turned into a cartoon fox right under his dad's nose and ran away from home to be with his best friend - and now husband - Benny Bunny.

For Janet Perch, the change came much later. Her college friend Valerie convinced her over a bottle of wine to try painting herself up as a white cartoon cat. As Bunny Cat, she found a life worth living for and a community she could call home.

She taught school in a sundown town, though, and toons were one of the things these people hated most. She kept her double life going until her heart couldn't take it anymore; then, in a desperate act of defiance, she revealed her toon identity and quit teaching on the spot.

Daniel was there the whole time, too. Now a mini-celebrity in the Realist world, he spent weeks on the cable news network tour dragging Bunny's name through the mud. Her career ruined, she moved in with Valerie and they've been together ever since.

The world's a lot different now. Toons aren't hiding in the shadows like we did in the past; we live open lives alongside real people. The president even recognized Tex Avery Month last year!

Sure, there was an election coming up. But the other guy was spending most of his time screaming about toons. We all knew the rhetoric wasn't popular, so we wrote it off as undisciplined.

Then he won, and all we had left was the hope he'd get distracted before coming after toons.

Inaguration day is tomorrow.

We're partying tonight. Both for a home we bought together and to stave off the gloom. Because sometimes, when your world is safe and silly, you tend to forget that some people want you to go away forever.

And sometimes, you have to party and forget to get through.

-Benny, Valerie, Fenton, and Bunny

# 1.1:

# Benny Bunny
The hardest part about living is that you keep changing, and the world changes around you, and that even the most solid rocks in your life refuse to stay still.

The party was already in full swing at my new two-flat when I arrived. Valerie the Cat was a few drinks in, and Fenton Fox’s laughter rang through the open-plan kitchen. I’d spent most of the afternoon at work—bunny social workers are always running late—but I’d planned to make it up to Fenton and the girls with a fantastic move-in party.

And oh, this two-flat! It’d been on the market for years thanks to the unique remodel from the early toon days: the shared downstairs great room, kitchen, and guest room; upstairs, private halves for each couple. In the finished basement, room for us all to chase our dreams. It wasn’t the most conventional setup, but it suited us.

At the time, though, it wasn't much to look at. There were boxes aplenty, and they'd organized those boxes into something resembling a living room: big box table, skinny box benches, long box banquet tables in the great room. There were only two things unpacked in the room at that time, and I could see both from the Chicago window that jutted out from the front room: a single, roughshod lamp that was too sad to pack sat atop my bright red upright piano.

I’d met Janet and Valerie years ago, back when I was running a small toon activist group. Janet’s story had exploded across the media, and I burned every favor I had to score tickets to the gala where she’d be. I got lucky that there was a piano for me to play—I almost blew it tripping over my words more than once, but that song I made up at the piano, drunk as my friend Mister Skunk, saved my _life_.

Of course, there’d been pushback when we floated the idea of living together—_thirty years is a big commitment_, _what about Fenton’s dad?_, _what if the media finds out (again)?_ But I countered with relentless optimism, silliness, and a ridiculous lowball offer on the property that somehow got accepted. A few months later, we were signing paperwork and moving in.

(Fenton thought the whole thing would be a disaster. To be fair, it kind of was. But for the two-flat? Totally worth it.)

I couldn’t wait to get through the door and revel in being done—with the lawyers, realtors, movers, all of it. Just as I reached for the key, the door swung open. I stumbled forward, catching myself on the jamb and nearly flattening an old lady in a cocktail dress holding a champagne flute. The champagne landed on me, and I caught her in a half-dip, tango-style.

We stayed there, adrenaline buzzing, until she broke the silence. “Well, Benny, at least buy me dinner before you go in for the kiss!”

I straightened her, cheeks blazing. “Gosh, I’m so sorry! I didn’t think anyone would be here. My husband usually—”

From inside, Fenton’s voice cut me off. “You dumb bunny! I told you Clover would be here!”

“Oh,” I stammered. “I’m—uh—flustered! Long day at work, Foxy.” I hopped over to him and planted a kiss on his cheek. Then, turning to the woman: “I’m Benny.”

She smirked. “Your husband wasn’t exaggerating about you being an idiot. Lucky for you, I like them dumb. Come on in!”

Inside, the chaos of move-in day reigned. Valerie and Janet bustled around the kitchen, bickering about whether Euchre was the perfect drinking game while setting out appetizers. Around us, cartoonish moving boxes mingled with old backpacks and tubs full of life’s leftovers.

I pulled out the piano bench and had a seat, running my fingers over the keys. They were clean, untouched since we’d moved in. It had been a while since I really played—longer than I wanted to admit.

“So you’re the player,” Clover said.

"Sure am!" I said. "Used to have a lot more time for it, but life kinda got in the way."

"Play something."

I hesitated. It had been ages since I’d sat down just to play for fun, without work or protests or some bigger goal looming over me. But this was _our_ place now, _our_ home, and if there was ever a time to bring music into it, it was now.

"I'm working on a theme song for the two-flat," I said, lying. Then I let my fingers find the chords, making something up to _Benny and the Jets_ on the fly.

> Hey kids, have you heard the news?  
> Benny’s back in town, and he’s payin’ his dues,
> With a white cat strut and a kitty girl prowl,  
> You’re gonna hear a lot of silly coming down…!
> Oh, Valerie’s got her claws out, and
> Janet’s painted up real proud,  
> B-b-b-Benny and the cats!
> Oh but they’re weird and they’re wonderful,
> And Benny he’s really keen  
> We’ve got Ink to spare…
> And no one cares…
> You know I read it on a Toontown train…
> Oh, Benny and the cats!

Valerie’s ears perked up. “You _dork_,” she said, but I caught the grin tugging at the corners of her mouth. She raised her wine glass in salute, swishing it like a conductor keeping time. “Sing it, piano bun!”

I played on, following the music wherever it cared to take me. A few bars, a few laughs, and suddenly, my nerves were gone. The weight of the day, the stress of moving, the sheer impossibility of this home we’d made for ourselves—it all melted into the music, into the warm hum of conversation, into the clinking of glasses and the thump of Valerie’s tail against the couch in time with the beat.

And we were happy. _Truly, deeply happy._ We’d faced our demons, picked up our swords, and come out the other side. This was a time for safety. For growth. For us.

# Valerie

I was drunk for two reasons.

(Well, three reasons, but I'm trying to forget about That Guy right now.)

For one, I wasn't used to having Mom around. It had been, what, ten years since we spoke last? And if I'm being totally honest, I missed her. It was nice to have her back. I cried when she made me fried chicken with the corn flakes—just like she did when I was a little girl!—and it was nice to catch up on family gossip for a little while.

But when she came back into my life, though, it was like none of the past had ever happened. No apologies, no acknowledgment, nothing. It was as if I'd just been on a ten-year-long European holiday, and we were picking up right where we left off. Never mind the pain she caused, the harsh things she said, the _everything about my coming out_ that I still had nightmares about. Nope! Let's just pretend that never happened.

_Can't you see how proud I am of my toon daughter?_ She would insist. And she genuinely believed that now.

_Now._

I kept expecting her to _say something_, if for nothing else than to acknowledge what happened. She's been visiting for months, and every time I hint at wanting to talk about it, she changes the subject. Like, at some point, the guilt's gotta eat you alive, and you admit to the shitty things you did, right? Right? Hell, I can't even miss a party without feeling like a total ass, and here she is, just ignoring a decade of bad blood to hang out with my toon friends, all smiles and laughs.

So that's bad enough, but then I had Janet's little... transformation to deal with.

Sorry, not Janet Perch. Not Bunny Cat. Ky. As in, _Kyle._ They showed me reference photos of what they wanted the infusion joint to do, and it was all I could do to not cry. My Bunny Cat girl wasn't so girly after all. In fact, they were just done with gender _entirely_, or so they said. Not that I know what the hell that means.

"I'm a guy," I could have handled just fine. I did scenes as a guy too, back in the day. But that was always a joke. I thought... well, that she was this girly-girl like me. Purses and makeup and every little accessory in-between-level girl.

But this? After all that fighting to be herself, she thinks this is the right move?

They didn't even let me help them pick their new look. Or their name. Said they wanted to trust the artist.

But I put it aside, and I know I can handle it later. Sometime. So I learned the pronouns, and I swallowed my pride on the name, and I kissed them and called them a good boi until I found joy in their joy.

(It's the little things you learn together that make marriage a joy, I guess, like "I'm so spitting mad at you right now and I can't help loving you for it" is a phrase that can, somehow, be true.)

So we'd spent the past few months learning about transition. But you can only have so many conversations about gender being like, alchemy dust or "yes, and" or whatever, and just... _fuck_.

I was supposed to have a happy ending, not more mess!

So yes, I overserved myself that night, and I'm not sorry about it. It was the only way I could handle what was coming next.

My mom put a hand on Benny's leg. "So my daughter Valerie was kind enough to take me in for a few months. It's a pleasure to finally meet you in person! I've heard so much about you."

He let out a hearty laugh and put his paw on her bony hand. "Well, I'm glad because I've heard absolutely nothing about you!"

She smiled that smile she always smiled when she was winding up for a pity party. Gods. I knew that smile from a mile away. It was the one she pulled out when charm was the answer when she knew she was wrong but she couldn't bring herself to admit it. Again.

_Why in the hell was I letting her live rent-free in my head?_

"I have a... well. This is a fine how-do-you-do, I know, but it's part of the story: I'm dying of cancer."

His face went blank. "Oh, I'm so sorry!"

"Don't break out the casket yet!" she replied, laughing. "I figured I was done for, but my daughters—er, my kids, sorry Ky!—they found a doctor in town who says they have a solution."

Benny's face relaxed. "Please tell me toons cured cancer."

"No. This is an alternative therapy. A little woo-woo, yes, but it works."

Fenton caught my eye and then looked down at the plate of messy nachos on the coffee table. Scowling, I grabbed a chip and chewed.

“There’s a place here in Toontown that does IV infusions,” Ky added from the kitchen. “So we did some tests, and we found out that I'm a good donor.

"They take some of my blood, then Doctor Taso does some wacky gag stuff to jump-start the transformation. Then they inject my blood into Mom, who then turns toon."

Clover threw her hands in the air. “I’m gonna be a fruit bat!”

Fenton looked to the white cat in the kitchen, who was currently fussing over a large, cartoon-looking roast. "Janet, did you just call yourself 'Ky'? Way to bury the lead! You're transitioning? Mazel tov!"

"Not transitioning, per se." They searched for the words. _Gods. Not the gender talk again._ "I guess... I guess I want to try something different for a while, and hey, if I don't like it, it's all just ink and paint. I can always erase and start over.

“But yeah. I'm thinking of it kinda like… like how friends of cancer patients would shave their head in solidarity. If Clover has to become something else to live, then I'm gonna be right there beside her.”

They met eyes and shared a warm smile. My breath caught in my throat. I tried to cover it up with a sip of wine, but Fenton pushed the glass down. He had taken a seat beside me while Mom was busy buttering up Benny.

"Eat," he said. He dipped a chip in cheese and made like an airplane heading for my mouth. "Open wide for your favorite fox!"

"You don't have to baby me."

"You look pissed," he whispered. I took the chip from his hand and started to nibble. Gods. Nothing better in this world to a drunk chick than a big ol' plate of nachos.

"I'm not pissed."

"Your tail says otherwise." Sure enough, the thing was whipping around like a cat that got caught in the rain. Stupid tails. Too cool to get rid of, but damn if they don't give away the game sometimes.

There's an old toon adage: "Stick to gags because toons don't have a poker face." So I grabbed my tail and hugged it around my waist, hoping to stop it from getting worse.

"Okay," I reached out for his hand again. "Let's get some air. Back in a second, sweetie!"

"Okay. Love you, honey!"

"Love you," I said, and then ducked out the door before she could read the fury swinging in my tail.

# Fenton
I knew I had to get Valerie outside, and fast. The last thing we needed the day before That Guy took over was a knock-down, drag-out argument in the new house with a woman Benny and I barely knew.

"Mind if I smoke?" she asked, rummaging in her purse.

"We've known each other for years, and I’m just now learning you smoke?" I teased.

"Only when my life is falling apart." Val pulled a clove cigarette from a small case and lit it. After a deep inhale, she hissed out a thin line of electric-blue smoke. "And speaking of which," she added wryly, flicking the ash from the end, "can you believe it’s now an outpatient procedure to turn yourself into a cartoon? Clover's getting hers done and her insurance is gonna cover it, 100%!"

I blinked in surprise. "I knew it was easier these days, but... fully covered? That’s wild."

Valerie shrugged. "If only they'd cover, like, family therapy. Or half the other stuff we actually need, right?"

"That's a stretch."

"Probably." She paused, inhaling again. "I just... I just can’t let it go, Fenton."

"I know." I gave a half-laugh. "Gods, I couldn't imagine how you’re doing this right now. If my dad were around—"

"He’d get his face punched in?" she finished for me.

I snorted and swept my ears back to regain my composure. "Yeah. You and the entire block, honestly."

"You know he ruined Janet’s career, right?"

"No!"

Valerie nodded. "He made a bunch of media appearances after Janet protested her treatment in that little Klantown she got stuck in. Claimed she—and by extension, all of us toons—should never work as teachers again."

"It wasn’t just about Janet, then?”

"Of course it was all toons, Fenton. Those people paint with a broad brush: toons bad, real people good. It’s so _annoying_, and so effective at the same time."

I sighed. "I guess so."

She smoked in silence for a moment, and I peered out onto the street. A pair of beavers teetered down the sidewalk, loudly discussing how much they loved a local theater. I felt a twinge of envy—no struggle in their stride, no sense of being outcasts. Just the simple, wholesome joy of truly belonging.

Ink and Paint had changed so much over the years. It wasn’t the headline-grabbing, panic-inducing scandal it used to be—no more nightly news reeling from some kid spontaneously morphing into a bright-yellow coyote or a pink cat. The phenomenon still ruffled feathers in some pockets of the country, but by and large, transformation was just another part of the cultural landscape.

"I’m sorry, by the way," I said quietly.

"For what?"

"For my dad," I admitted. "For what he did to Ky."

"Oh, sweetie, that isn’t your fault!"

I fiddled with the tips of my ears. "Sometimes I feel like if I’d told him about my own transformation sooner, or done it more... I don’t know... more carefully, he might have come around. Maybe I wouldn’t have burned him so hard on my way out the door."

Valerie shook her head. "You can’t second-guess the past."

"Guess not." Then I realized I might be hogging the conversation. "Sorry. Didn’t mean to make it about me."

"You’re fine, Fenton. We all have scars. Yours just happen to have gotten media attention.

"What’s he doing these days, anyway?" she asked.

I shrugged. "Don’t know, don’t care. I’m just glad I don’t see him on TV anymore."

"He quit the media circuit?"

"Seems so." I locked my hands behind my head and gave them a squeeze, feeling tension radiate through my shoulders. "He just... vanished a few years ago. Sometimes I wonder—"

"Your tail’s limp, foxy. You can say it."

My cheeks flushed, and I had to laugh at being so transparent. "I think about him more than I’d like to admit."

"It’s okay. He’s your dad." She took another drag of her cigarette. "Even if he’s an insufferable asshole who deserves a thorough punch in the mouth. And you’re allowed to grieve that relationship."

"Just like you have to grieve who Ky used to be," I said, offering a gentle smile.

"Fuck you," Val coughed, smoke pluming. "Using my own words against me like that."

"Love you bunches!"

"Mm. Love you too, idiot." She flicked her ashes away. "But I’m gonna smoke another because I’m not ready to be all yay-rah for Bun—I mean, _Ky’s_ new body. Wanna stay?"

"Wouldn’t miss it," I said, sliding over to lean on the railing. "But only if you let me bum one."

A small snort escaped Val. "You too?"

"Old habit from engineering school." I wiggled my muzzle in mock guilt. "Don’t tell Benny."

She grinned. "Your secret’s safe."

We lit up together. My mind tried not to think about how bitter the cloves tasted, but at least I was there for Val. Even if I had to lie a bit to do it.

"Wild world," she murmured, exhaling smoke. "People can just decide to be a cartoon if they want to."

She wasn’t wrong. Ten years ago, it was rebellious, messy, uncontrollable: kids spontaneously turned, parents panicked, the authorities got heavy-handed. Over time, though, it mainstreamed. Pharmacies stocked Ink on shelves. Spa days offered short-term transformations for a fun weekend look. Society—well, some of it—bent in acceptance, though a few places remained stubbornly gray.

"You can get a bottle of Ink in any drugstore," she mused, hissing smoke from her lips.

"Not in Idaho," I added, recalling the stories.

"Not in Idaho," she echoed. And we shared a wry, knowing look.

After we finished our cigarettes, I reached for the doorknob. "Ready to head inside?"

Val took a deep breath, eyes closed. She smoothed down her tail and exhaled one last time, purring softly as the tension drained from her.

"It’s gonna be okay," she said, more to herself than to me. "It always will be."

"Yeah." I nodded, hand on the knob. "It will."

I turned to open the door, but a gravelly, familiar voice called my name. "Fenton?"

We both froze. Standing behind us was an old man, thin and haggard, leaning on a cane with a look so worn it pained me to see. He had hollow cheeks and a sad slope to his shoulders, but beneath it all was a face I recognized in an instant.

"Come on." he asked hopefully. "It’s your old man."

Valerie’s ears flattened, her eyes going wide in fury. "Daniel Cobbler?"

"Unfortunately so," he said, raising both hands in a meek gesture. "Warts and all. I... I know I’m probably not welcome here."

He stepped closer, arms almost out for a hug he clearly wasn’t going to get, not from me. I glanced at Val; she looked ready to snap. I turned back to Daniel.

"Come in," I muttered, tone icier than I intended. "Last thing Jazztown needs is a media frenzy if someone spots you. You’re basically Public Enemy Number One here, you know."

His face twisted with regret. "I’m aware. But thank you for your hospitality nonetheless."

"No," Val snarled. "Fuck this. I'm getting him a cab."

Daniel’s gaze drifted to her, then back to me. "And you are…?"

"The wife of someone you messed up real bad," she spat. Before she could unleash more, I gently ushered her inside, stepping up to block the growing tension.

"Leave it, Val. This won’t take long."

She seethed but turned on her heel and went in. I remained on the threshold, squared my shoulders, and faced my father for the first time in ten years.

_It's gonna be okay,_ I whispered to myself. *He's in my house now.*

# 1.4:

# Ky

Benny poured champagne for the room. Two flutes sat unclaimed while Fenton helped Val get some air. I thought, briefly, about drinking the glass for her, if for nothing else than to help her sober up.

"Can we get Val some water too?" I asked. "And maybe we should give her just a quarter glass of the bubbles."

"Or sparkling white grape juice," Benny said. "She's smashed. But enough about her. Tell us about your new body!"

"I’m uh. Right! I guess I’m doing this. I’m going to go by Ky from now on. They/them pronouns. And as for the look..."

I smiled, then, with a sudden jolt, walked over to show everyone a photo on my phone. In it was a shorter, slightly masculine cartoon cat, animated in the style of computer animation, with a voice that was at once gravelly and full of helium. In many ways, it was a complete clusterfuck of an identity. Hence why I loved it.

Clover applauded. "Oh, that's _gorgeous!_"

“Killer," Benny said. "Who designed it?”

“Well, its less of a ‘design’ and more of a goal. Apparently there’s a lot of random variables, but this what the animation computers think I’ll come out to, approximately.

“It’s a very, well.” he fumbled for words. “It’s very _neutral_.”

“Soft queer meets soft paws,” she said.

It was around that point that Valerie came back in without Fenton, her eyes wide with shock. She ran to the couch, took a seat, and leaned in close to whisper.

"You'll never fucking believe this," she said. I noted the smell of adrenaline on the air, and how clear-headed she seemed in that moment. "Just... never, ever, _ever_ fucking believe this.

"Daniel Cobbler is on our doorstep."

My heart dropped like a stone. "Fenton's Dad? The guy who ruined my reputation?"

"Yeah." Valerie spat. "The sheer _gall_, you know, to just show up after doing that kind of damage!"

"Who is Daniel?" Clover asked.

"Fenton's father." Benny explained. "Big-name Realist. He drummed Ky out of the teaching industry entirely."

He stood to look out the window, blinked in disbelief, and rubbed his whiskers. "Guy's got two toon kids, and he spent the past decade of his life acting like this total... just, a total douchenozzle. Jumping from cable news show to cable news show, complaining about how things were turning toon.

"I should go out there." Benny said.

"Fenton seemed fine," Valerie said.

"I'm going out there," Benny insisted, but before he could do so the front door opened again, and two sets of footsteps could be heard.

Like it or not, Daniel Cobbler was going to be the guest of dishonor at our table that night.

# Fenton

I stood there, dumbfounded both by Daniel's presence on my doorstep and with the way my little family rubbernecked from the bay window.

How do you even start talking to a father you haven't seen in a decade? Hugs seem like too much, considering he spent my teenage years trying to make it harder for me to exist as a toon. Certainly not small talk, after he continued to maign toons' good name on the news circuit.

I wanted to yell, or snap, _something_ to push back against this Very Wrong Thing Happening. But looking at him in the early twilight, his gaunt features draped in shadow by the overhead patio light, I just couldn't find it in me to be angry.

He was just so _old_ now.

"You look well," he said, coughing a bit to cover the awkward moment.

"You look like hell."

"I see you never lost your honesty," Dad -- Daniel -- said with a chuckle. "I'm glad I could raise you right in at least some way."

"Some nerve you got, showing up in Jazztown like this."

"I'm an old man," Daniel said. He picked up his cane for emphasis. "I'm invisible to them. But yes, I'm painfully aware of how much people here must hate me. I read all the hate mail I get."

"So you're not here to cause trouble, but you're still here. I'm guessing this isn't a pleasure visit," I said with a grumble. "What's your angle?"

"I'm really sorry." Daniel said. He wiped a tear from his eye. "I should have done this sooner. Back when there weren't complications. Back before I had to come here, hat in hand."

I remained expressionless. "So you do have an angle then."

"Unfortunately." He took a deep breath to center himself. Then he pulled a piece of paper from his pocket for reference. "This is what happens when you try to tough things out, I guess.

"I started feeling out of breath when I turned 60. Didn't think much of it at the time, since I was doing all those media tours. Figured it was just fatigue, so I pushed through it."

"Much to toons' chagrin," I added. I couldn't help myself.

"I know." He looked down to the page. "Son, I have advanced cardiac amyloidosis. The doctors put me on palliative care."

I expected, bad as this sounds, to feel happy when I heard this. For years I wished he would just hurry up and die so I could move on. But now, looking at this frail old man in front of me, literally wasting away before my eyes, I couldn't bring myself to even smile.

Before I could let my emotions get the best of me I fired off a question: "What's that got to do with me?"

"It's hereditary," Daniel continued. "You need to get tested. And," he paused to hand me the paper - an article on the disease - before continuing. "If I'm being honest, I missed you."

"I didn't."

"I understand, son. And I promise I won't intrude. But I did want you to know one thing:

"I'm sorry. I made your young adult life a real mess. And I know I can't take that back, but I couldn't go to the grave without saying that to you."

"That's it?"

"That's all." He tipped his cane in my direction, then nodded to the window. Everyone, from Benny to Val to even Clover, were looking out the window and speaking in hushed whispers.

"You and Benny seem really happy with your friends. I won't take that away from you by making my presence known."

He made it three steps down the street while I held my face in my hands, not sure how to respond to what just happened. But whatever that response was, I was gonna be the better man.

"Dad!"

He stopped and turned around.

"Look, you can't leave now. bars are opening up and someone WILL recognize you. And you said some pretty vile things about us toons in the past. Things we can't forget."

"I know."

I shrugged. "Besides, the Boomtown bar on the corner prides itself on using Real dynamite for its gags on Friday nights, so it's unsafe for Real people to boot."

Gods, I couldn't believe I was about to do this.

"Come on in," I said, holding the door open. "You can stay on our couch tonight. I'll get you a cab tomorrow."

Dad's old, soft smile - the one I remembered from going uppies as his little kid - warmed me to the core. And there it was, still bright even in the haze of twilight. Still with that sparkle in the eye. The joy of fatherhood, he always called it. Before he threw my kind to the curb, that is.

"I'd appreciate that," he said. "Home's a little lonely these days anyway. Tom doesn't talk to me, Irine is, well... I don't even know anymore. Dating life dried up after I started making TV appearances. So it's either stay with you, or go home to a lean cuisine and a night of Foxes Newsspot."

I winced at his choice of channel, but tried my best to ignore it. "And be cool, okay? These people are my family, and if you mistreat any of them..."

He laughed, holding up a hand to stop me from launching into an angry monologue. "You've grown up good, son. I promise to be respectful."

There are many things I will call my dad. a Realist? sure. Distant? Definitely. Misguided? Of course. But Daniel Cobbler is, at his heart, a man of his word. I knew he'd be good.

"Good. Come inside." I waved him through the door. "And for what it's worth, it's nice to see you too."

You could hear a pin drop when Daniel entered the living room.

I mean, I knew him from TV news from the last decade. He was always on those cable news shows as a talking head, usually in a debate with a toon talking head, with a moderator who didn’t care to push for consensus. It’s the kind of thing you see when you get an oil change, you know? Notable, but not noteworthy.

But these toons? My kids? Fenton, Fenton’s bunny boy whose name I couldn’t quite remember? You could _feel_ the rage bubbling under their fur. The air crackled with raw energy, and I swear I could see some ominous clouds form as they continued to glare.

For his part, Fenton tried to put on a brave face. The cats seemed to like that about him most; that he stood firm, poised under pressure, no matter how great. Seeing him with my own two eyes, I could understand the respect and love they had for him. He put on his best smile and presented Daniel to the group like a host unveiling a prize on a game show.

“Everyone, I know you need no introduction, but this is my father, Daniel. Dad,” he pointed at each of us in turn, “Clover, my husband Benny, Valerie, Ky.”

“Miss Perch,” Daniel said with a sage nod. “I remember you. I’m—”

Ky snapped their fingers to shut him up. “Get fucked, asshole.” They rose from the couch and stormed back to the kitchen together. I could hear Ky crying as they turned the corner.

He looked to the room with an apologetic expression. “I’m sorry. I deserved that. I hope I can make it up to them at some point.”

His face washed over with... regret, I guess?

“In any case, it’s a pleasure to meet you all.”

She had been on the way out of the room, but Valerie pivoted on a dime when she heard the word. “Pleasure?” Valerie’s eyebrows raised and her hackles followed. “I thought you hated toons.”

Daniel considered his words very carefully before responding. “I think we’ve all grown in the past decade,” he said at long last. “And please, let Ky know I really am truly sorry—”

“Shush.” Benny stood up to join them. “The toons are talking. You’re not welcome here.”

And then you could hear the sounds of far-off explosions, laughter, and the general joy of Jazztown over the silence. Fenton fussed with the collar of his shirt, looked to the kitchen with a sad frown, and turned back to his dad. They stood in the doorway, unsure of how the script unfolds from there.

“Well, it’s a pleasure to meet you too, Daniel. I’ve only just met your son and, let me say this straight, you’ve raised a fine young fox fella in this one.”

I offered my hand to him. Fenton mouthed “thank you” and his shoulders relaxed.

His touch was gentle, warm, strong. There was secret, baker-like strength in him.

“Thank you, madam.”

“Clover.”

“Clover.” He chuckled. “That means more than you’ll ever know.”

“Let me offer you some advice,” Clover said, her face growing hard and her tongue suddenly cutting. “You’re already on strike one with these folks, coming in here like nothing happened.

“If you don’t want to strike out, you’re gonna need a lot less ‘pleasure’ and a lot more ‘I’m sorry.’”

I looked him dead in the eye. _I know your game,_ I thought, long and hard, hoping he’d eventually hear it. He’s not the first person to come to an estranged child, hat in hand, looking for forgiveness because they’re dying soon.

“You’re straight to the point, aren’t you?”

I tipped my champagne glass his way. “Only when I’m protecting my kids, you better fucking believe it.”

Daniel glanced at her, his expression softening. “And you’ve done your share of damage too, haven’t you, Clover? None of us leave this life without scars—our own and the ones we give others.”

For a moment, Clover flinched, her composure wavering. Then she smiled thinly. “I’m not the one who left my kid with those scars, Daniel. But you go on with your ‘sorrys.’”

“I was going to say you are right. I have a lot of ‘sorrys’ to say.”

“Batter up, Daniel Cobbler. Pitcher’s winding up.”

I looked over to Fenton, who was doing everything in his power to swallow down tears and stifle his sobs.

“But here I am, chastising you with champagne when I should be toasting! Fenton, you haven’t had any of your glass yet. Would you mind letting your dad have it?”

The tears burst loose. Fenton gave a nod and disappeared into the bathroom. The full-on bawling came out seconds later.

“Strike two.”

I saw the tired in his bones, the sadness in his soul. I heard a low, accepting grumble, begrudging but respectful.

“I have this effect on people,” Daniel said, laughing. “I guess I should expect that, the way I used my words over the past decade.”

“We’re both bullshitters, Daniel. Words come easy for us. But _actions_ matter. Commitments matter. Love matters. And you broke that; you’ll have to reckon with that eventually.”

His eyes flashed with sudden recognition, and then he raised his glass.

“To being the first heartbreaker to our children.”

I laughed. He joined me. It was a warm laugh. Soft like honeysuckle and welcoming as a wood fire.

“The Heartbreakers, eh? Sounds like a great mom and pop band. I’ll drink to that!” And then, laughing together, we clinked glasses.

# 1.7:

# Benny

If the living room was a thunderstorm, the kitchen was a torrential downpour. Quite literally, really. Between Ky falling apart in the kitchen and Fenton sprinting for the bathroom to bawl, there was a lot of waterworks going on.

We needed a rally.

I picked the now-wet flyer from my pocket and unfolded it. "Listen. I know it's a bad time."

Valerie snapped at me. "You fucking think?"

Ky spat out their words. "The gall of that guy, just showing up at our doorstep like that! After all he did, all he ruined..." They broke down again, and Valerie wrapped her arms around them while they cried.

And honestly? I'd be damned if I let that guy fuck up my life again. "Look, I know he hurt all of us. But this house? This is ours. We’re taking something broken and making it whole, together. That starts now. Not tomorrow, not next week. Right now. So uh, yeah. Here."

I walked over to our impromptu liquor cabinet - a Real milk crate Ky had around since college - and grabbed a toon whisky called "Here's Lookin at the Loo, Kid" and poured shots into solo cups for the three of us.

"For the two-flat," I said. "A nip to steel your nerves so we can go out and party this man into shame. We'll be so bubbly and happy, despite _everything_ he did. 

"And when he asks to join," I continued, a wicked smile crossing my face, "we can look down upon him and say 'no.'"

Valerie's ears flicked and her head tilted to one side. "...Okay, yeah. Yeah, that works. But the toast: should we wait for Fenton?"

"He doesn't drink much," I said, pushing my shot into the center of our impromptu crying circle. "And besides, if I were you I'd--"

"To new beginnings," Ky said, tapping their glass to mine. "and to old wounds."

Toon or not, whisky was always the same. A moment of fire in your throat, the taste of whatever wood the barrel was made of masked over the price you paid the next day for drinking it. And honestly, it's not my cup of... well... booze?

Her tail had this way of shivering when she had something strong; somewhere between pleasure and annoyance, as far as I could tell. Never really knew why she hit that stuff so hard anyway. It's okay, I guess, but not worth the late nights over the toilet, if you catch my drift.

So yeah, Valerie could sure put it away. Ky, too, but Valerie was a champ in and of herself.

It was around that time that Fenton made his way out of the bathroom. He joined us in the kitchen, and I gave him the biggest, loveliest hug imaginable. I whispered in his big fox ears: "You okay?"

"I will be, yeah." He refused to let me go. “I’ve spent years trying to forget him—everything he did, everything he believed in. And now he’s here, looking so… small. It’s not fair, you know? He hurt us, but now he’s too fragile to hate properly.”

"Old people can still be evil," I said, patting his back. "Look at Palpatine."

"Palpatine isn't my father," Fenton stammered. "Palpatine wasn't the one who took me on cool father-son trips to look at architecture. He was a decent man, Benny." 

He squeezed tighter before letting me go. "Once upon a time, at least. I'm sorry, everyone. I had no idea--"

Ky put a hand on Fenton's paaw."--Dude, you are the last one who owes an apology right now. Fault lies entirely with him."

Fenton looked away when they said it, and before he could start in on his past I jumped in. "But listen, we have a plan. We party him into shame. Show him such a good time that he feels bad about what he did in the past."

"Oh god," Fenton said. He jabbed me in the chest playfully. "He's on a tear trying to get y'all to think positive, isn't he?"

The girls -- the cats, I mean! -- nodded in unison. "Dumb bunny himbos do what dumb bunny himbos do, I guess."

Fenton's eyebrows furrowed. "I'm confused. My dad - the guy who ruined most of our young adult lives - shows up on the doorstep, and your plan is to _party him into changing_?"

"Pretty much," I said with a shrug.

"I love you," Fenton said. He gave me a peck on the cheek. "But he's a stick in the mud."

"Then we get him a cab," Valerie said. "I'm more than happy with plan B, if I'm being honest. Sooner he's out of our neighborhood the better."

Fenton's whiskers twished as his face scrunched up with worry. "That's the thing, Val. It's a Friday night. Jazztown's strip is in full swing, and it's the main artery out of the neighborhood. It'd be the equivelent of perp-walking him through a sea of his enemies."

"So?" Valerie punched her claws into her paw to make her point. "He made his bed. He gets to lie in it. If he didn't want to be hated, he shouldn't have done what he did in the first place."

"No."

"Fenton--"

"I said no, okay?" He was snapping, now. His tail went extra bushy and honestly, that's just a dead giveaway that you're getting nowhere fast with him. "Guys, I did the media circus once upon a time. You did too, Ky. Where they shove cameras in your face and ask all the questions that are eating you up inside. I just... I don't want to do that again. and besides..."

He trailed off. Ky reached out for his hand and said, "Fenton, we're listening."

"I just don't want that for him," he continued. "For anyone. And I don't know, I guess it's just hard to stay angry with him when he looks this old and frail."

"I was going to ask about that," Benny said. He slid an arm around my shoulder. "What's going on?"

"He’s dying," Fenton said. Silence fell over the kitchen, the air suddenly heavier. "And its hereditary. He came all this way to let me know."

"Gods," Val said.

"I'm so sorry," Ky said.

Me? I rubbed my paws together. "So... Plan A. Party him to death."

"Benny!" Valerie swatted at me, but I caught the corner of Fenton’s smile.

"Look," Fenton said. "He was a giant ass to us. No questions there. But he's my _dad_, guys. He wouldn't show up here if he had any other option."

"Plan C," I said, squeezing Fenton a little tighter. "'Party him to the pain.' Wait, 'party him to the shame?' Yeah. I like that one better."

I picked up the champagne glass from earlier. "To the shame, then."

"To the shame!"

Fenton's smile grew a little warmer, his spine straightening out as he stood a bit taller. "Thanks, guys."

"But I'm calling a short-order painter to make him a toon air mattress. Could go to the superstore on the Real side of town, but nah, I'm here for smothering him in toon stuff." I paused. "Wait, no! Since he made his bed on anti-toon stuff, what better petty punishment than a full-on deluxe toon bed for him to lie in?"

My husband shook his head and tried to hide a laugh. "That is petty, and also _very_ acceptible. Make it happen, babe."

I pecked him on the cheek and made for the back door. "Ky, want to come with me? No offense, but I think the sons and daughters have a lot to talk about with their parents."

He took Ky's white paw and gave it a good, hard tug. They got the message.

"We'll be back in an hour or two," they said. Ky went in for a kiss with Val, just like I did. Val paused before letting it connect. I put a pin in it; something to talk about later, when the disaster's blown over.

Just another emotional mess for me to manage, that's all.

Day one in the two-flat and we were already doing awkward in-law sleepovers. Family really does form fast, doesn't it?

# 1.8:

# Valerie

...and then there were four. Me, Fenton the Fox, Daniel fucking Cobbler, and my mother, all grins and no substance, pretending everything is going to be okay.

We sat around a coffee table made of taped-up moving boxes, none of us saying that much. Mom sipped her champagne. Dad too. Fenton looked around and rubbed his shoulder with a free paw. Lost.

We were all lost.

"Well," Daniel said. His voice echoed off the bare walls. "It's a nice place you have here. Old school greystone, right?"

Fenton took a breath and let it out slowly. "Yes, Dad. Our nearest connection to the Real world is Chicago, so some of the buildings here have that vibe."

"I lived in the garden unit of one of these, way back in the day. Was a girl, of course." He looked to Fenton. "This was before your mom, of course. Back before people started, well."

He shrugged his shoulders and waved a hand toward the world around him.

"Before all this. She was in a touring band so I offered to housesit. Gods, nothing better than the back patio of a two-flat, joint in one hand and lager in another. No place like it in the world."

Fenton's eyes lit up with shock. "You never told me about that, Dad! You smoked?"

"Lots of things you don't know about me, actually." He chuckled. "I just figured I'd share the stories once you got older. But, well. You know how that went."

"Yeah."

A warm smile crossed his face.

"You've grown up good, kiddo."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Ten years, this guy spent snuffing his own goddamn son. And now he has the gall to come in here and pretend like things are just hunky-dory? No. Not to my Fenton. My fists balled and my ears laid flat against my head as I rose to speak: "You don't even fucking know him--"

A strong, lithe hand grabbed my tail and gave it a squeeze, knocking me off of my rhythm. It was mom, of course, doing one of her subltle control moves. "Sweetie," she said, her voice at once full of honey and bite, "Could you get Daniel and myself a refill? I think we could all use something to take the edge off."

Her grip on my tail tightened just enough to remind me who was really in charge.

I rolled my eyes and let my arms fall loose at my sides. "Of course, Mom."

"Thank you." She tugged me closer to whisper: "I got your foxy boy's back. Trust me."

Trust her. After she threw me out when I started showing signs of "the plague," as it was called back then. Back when kids turned into toons without reason. Back when we were anathemae, cordoned off in our own little box away from the normal Real people. I can still hear her shrill voice shouting as I packed my things and left:

"What will the town think?"

"Did you at least _try_ to Get Real?"

"I think you should get a second opinion."

"I can't stand the sight of you as a cartoon cat. I can't hear your voice without crying about what I lost.

"I hate you, Valerie, from here to the ends of the Earth!"

The words boiled in my blood. My heart became a furnace, roiling with steam and smouldering with low fuel. I wasted no time grabbing the champagne from the kitchen and bringing it tableside. My claws dug shallow furrows into the glass, and I thought, briefly, about shattering it against the bare wall, if for nothing else to hear something different from the forced pleasantries and awkward silences.

_He made my friend cry. Fuck being polite._

She waited for me to pour but I refused. She chuckled and, leaning over my space, proceeded to pour her own drink. Her eyes locked with Fenton's. "You know, I found out that your father and I have something in common."

Daniel nodded. "We're both dying."

"Death buds!" Clover said. She paused for laughter but received none. "Okay, yeah. Too grim. But it sure does sneak up on you, doesn't it?"

Daniel managed an amused chuckle at that.

I could see Fenton seething right alongside me. We took each others hand and squeezed, tighter than tight, knowing that if we could grit and bare it before, we could manage it now.

We had to. _They were dying, after all._

I looked at Fenton and mouthed "what now?", and all he could do was shrug.

Daniel picked up the cards and gave them a shuffle. "I see someone here's a Euchre fan. Clover, do you know the game?"

Clover's eyes lit up. She cleared off the box. "It's been a while, but yes. Valerie, would you be my partner?"

I wanted to scream, but Fenton held my attention. "Say something nice," his eyes pleaded. So I swallowed my pride and sat down to the table. "I'm a fan of the game. But I'm Fenton's partner, okay? The toons versus the Realist goons. We play ace-no-face redeals here, and don't do any of that 'swap 3 cards for the kitty' bs, mom. It makes the game way too easy."

Mom looked put out, the way she always does when she feigns being hurt. I knew better. She'd dished out more than her fair share in the past. She just hated to take it. 

I did what mom taught me to do: make small talk. "Fenton told me about your diagnosis. I'm very sorry to hear about it."

"Not how I wanted to go out," he said. "But yes. If it helps you feel better, I've lived my life and, well, done my damage. It's happening a little earlier than I expected, but as the bunny said in the other room, I did make my bed. Death just means its my turn to lie in it."

He smiled without malice. This wasn't a dig, this was a genuine gift of grace, and I hated receiving it. My face flushed. Everyone laughted. _Of course he heard us talking in the kitchen._

Daniel dealt five cards to each of us in groups of two and three. The rest of the cards he straightened into a neat, tiny pile on the table before flipping the bid card: a nine of hearts.

"Pick that up," Fenton said. "I'm going alone."

Fenton laid down two red jacks and an ace of hearts. In Euchre-speak, the were the three strongest cards for that hand. (Yes, Euchre does that weird thing where jacks are top trump, but _only_ if they're the same color as the called suit. I don't get it myself; I just like the game.)

Daniel and Clover threw three cards to represent playing three tricks in a row. (And yes, Euchre is a fast game full of shortcuts at the table. When you grow up learning it in the Midwest it's as natural as breathing.)

Fenton considered his next card for a moment before tossing out a king of spades. "Why now, dad? Why not the wedding, christmas, _basic holidays_, any time but now to crawl up to my door?"

Clover played her card, looked to Daniel, and waited for an answer.

"It's hard to admit you're wrong, kiddo. One day, you're gonna learn that."

"But you walked up to _my_ door, six months to live, and it's like nothing happened. No apology, no acknowledgement, not even a fuck-you. Just 'I miss you, oh! And almost forgot, _I'm dying_.'"

He threw a nine. Fenton swept the trick.

His eyes dropped to the floor. "I'm sorry, for whatever that's worth. I hope one day you can believe that of me. And you, Miss Valerie."

"I'm not the one to apologize to," I spat.

Fenton played his last card. If he took the trick, he'd score a "loner" - worth four points in a game played to ten.

"I was going to say that I am floored and inspired by your deep love for your partner. Really and truly, I appreciate how much you want to protect them."

I blinked, many times. I could feel sweat drops drawing up and out of my head. "Okay. You're going to need to back up and hit me with that truck again, Daniel."


Daniel held up his hands in defense. "I'm serious! I never knew Ky personally, but I did watch all the news specials released on you two. I always respected how hard you were willing to go to the mat for them. --It is 'they/them,' right?"

"I--uh." This just didn't make sense. "Yeah. How did you know?"

"My other kid is trans, and let me tell you, she's a firecracker!" Daniel said. Grinning, he lost himself in a long-lost memory. When it faded, his face fell again. "Haven't talked to Suzie in a while, though."

"I didn't know she went with Suzie."

Daniel looked to his son, concerned. "You get cut off too?"

"We just drifted apart," he said with a shrug. "Without you or mom around to anchor us we sort of, well, went our separate ways, honestly."

"I--" he closed his eyes and produced a handkerchief from the front pocket of his shirt. He wiped his eyes. "Huh. That makes sense, son. I'm sad to hear it though."

It was at that point that Clover played her last card: an ace. "Good thing I have the stopper," she said, placing her card on top of Fenton's last card. "No going alone at this table, baby!"

"Dang! That should've been a lay-down hand!"

"I got lucky." She sipped her champagne. Now, my fox friend, those questions are all tomorrow's problem. Probably many tomorrows' problems, if my hunch is right. Why not enjoy the reunion in front of you before you poison it with the past?"

Another sip. The deal passed to Fenton. As he dealt the euchre cards, Daniel leaned back and chuckled.

I glared at him. "Are you laughing about all this?"

"No. No. It just reminded me of a story." He picked up his cards, took a sip of wine, and launched into storytelling mode.

"Did I ever tell you about the time I was the guest of honor at the Southern Realist Convention? Gods, what a trash fire. I sat in on a panel of state policymakers talking about the time they tried to ban colorful socks. They thought it would keep out 'toon influences.'"

Fenton raised an eyebrow, a hint of disbelief mixed with amusement. "You're kidding, right?"

"Nope. Imagine a bunch of stuffy folks in fancy three-piece suits lecturing on the dangers of argyle and polka dots." His laughter was infectious, and even Valerie couldn't help but crack a smile.

He continued, "I used to believe all sorts of nonsense. But socks? _Socks_? I felt like the bright purple socks I wore to that panel must have been quite risque to them, looking back!"

Despite my every instinct, I found myself laughing along as he jumped from story to story, until a hub of laughter and nostalgia formed around that table, slowly melting away the tension.

# 1.9:

# Ky

Our painter guy worked on the main strip, which was perfect for us. I needed to see some toons having fun on the town, and Benny needed so badly to humiliate that man into silence. So we took a right on Avery Lane, shoved our way past the merrymakers on the sidewalk, and ducked into the Gortress, a full-service paint shop run by a bat named Gor.

This was one of the joys of living in the toon world. Need something? The painters create it. Need a new face? They have full-body painting services that can make a whole new _you_. Need a succulent roast to impress the neighbors? They're gonna make that drawing _sizzle_. If you could imagine it, the painters could make it.

A bell rang as we opened the door. Gor looked up from a side project, best I could tell. It was a headband with expertly painted dog ears attached on top. "I'll be with you in a minute," he said. "Just need one more coat over here."

The walls were covered with pictures of Gor's previous work. Toon statues in Prague. A signed picture of a senator wearing a cartoon elephant head and a huge grin. And makeover pictures. So, so many pictures of drunk tourists picking the most basic, formulaic cartoon looks they could before hitting the 4AM bars with the toons. Everyone — from the stoic bros to the teens looking to experiment with a new body experience — _everyone_ left the Gortress with a smile.

I could get used to having a good painter within walking distance, honestly.

Finished, the bat sauntered over to the register. "Sorry for the wait, friends. I try to make fashion accessories when things are dead. You wouldn't _believe_ what the Reallies pay for hand-painted toon stuff. What can I do you for?"

Benny approached the register. "Kind of dead tonight, isn't it?"

"We get our pop around 11, when the drunkards from Wrigleyville make their way over to Averytown to indulge their secret fantasies."

"That's kinda surprising," Benny said. "Wrigleyville?"

He shrugged. "We're the closest street to Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood. We get the fae gays and the sports-loving straights here, and everyone gets along. Kind of a beautiful melting pot, actually."

"Amazing. Well, I hope it's not too much to ask for a fancy toon bed," Benny said. "Something king-size, comfy, but _definitely_ toon. Like, I want this thing to squash and stretch when anyone so much as touches the mattress. Bonus points if the bedposts can sing lullabies or something."

"So a kid's bed, but big-sized?"

Benny leaned in close to whisper something. Gor's eyes went wide.

"No way."

"Yes way!"

"Daniel Cobbler?" He chuckled. "Haven't heard that name in a long time. He's still kickin?"

Benny laughed. "My husband is his son."

"Oh fuck, Fenton lives here?"

"He does now," Benny said. "But he's a bit shy. I'm sure you'll meet him someday soon!"

"Well, shit. Now I gotta make sure you're regulars." He cleared a space in the back of the shop, dipped a fountain pen in black ink, and began to sketch in the dimensions of Daniel's new bed.

"I followed all the news stories. Fenton's why I got into painting in the first place! If he could be strong enough to stand up to his old man, well, me painting myself into a bat didn't seem so weird.

"But I heard Daniel went radio silence a few years back. Even on all the docuseries about your hubby, he refuses interviews. What's he doing here, anyways?"

"Maybe he grew up."

Gor snorted. "That crybaby bitch couldn't even handle toons _existing_. That's ten-ply, man."

"Yeah," Benny agreed. "Soft as fuck."

When he sat back down I looked at him like he had grown three heads.

"What?"

"You just told him about Daniel."

"Yeah. Because it's funny and ironic! What's wrong?"

"...after Fenton spent the past hour or so insisting that we had to keep Daniel a secret?"

Benny's smile gave way to panic. "Oh no."

Gor piped up from across the room, where he was switching from the liner pen to a cel brush. "Guys, I've done paint jobs for dozens of realists at this point. All confidential, all cash, and boy howdy, did they ever tip well for me to keep quiet! Your secret's safe with me."

Benny took a deep breath before answering. "Gosh, Gor, you're going to end up with regulars at this point."

"That's the plan," he said. "And honestly? If you're local you take precedence over the tourists. I want to serve the toons who live here more than anything else."

Ky smiled. "We appreciate that."

He went quiet as the brush tucked bedclothes onto the mattress. Smiled as he added eyes and a mouth to the bedknobs. He added a little gag under the mattress that would swaddle a restless sleeper in a blanket, like a little bed mother coddling a child. And just like that, we had a new bed for the house.

I felt Benny's hand on my shoulder. "Are you okay?" he asked.

He put a paw over mine and gave a gentle squeeze.

We sat together while Gor worked, the hum of his airbrush filling the silence. "Valerie’s been… a lot lately," I said softly, the words slipping out before I could stop them. "I’m trying to keep up, but it’s chaos. Last week, she decided to reorganize the entire attic and then stayed up until 3 AM repainting the bathroom. Before that, she took on three extra shifts at work, just because she could. It’s like she’s got this endless energy for… I don’t know. Everything."

Benny nodded, his smile dimming. "I get that. Sometimes I hate how much is always _going on_ with her. It’s like she’s racing to finish three lifetimes in one."

"And all of this while still drinking us under the table!"

"That's... yeah."

"Makes me feel slow," I admitted. "Like I’m not doing enough."

He glanced at me. "Ky, you’re doing fine. You’re not slow. You’re steady. You keep us grounded."

"And Val used to be _my_ rock, way back when. But now it's just... there's a wall between us, you know? Ever since Mom moved in, really."

"I..." Benny sighed. "I know. We can talk about it with her. Tomorrow. I promise."

Across the street, a roar of laughter broke through the moment. We both turned to see a rooftop bar erupt in applause. Shooter Blanks, the drag king everyone seemed to know, was midway through their famous inflation gag. Their body expanded with exaggerated cartoon elasticity, inflating like a giant balloon until they nearly eclipsed the skyline. Then, with a perfectly timed "pop," they burst into a dazzling shower of glitter that rained down on the cheering crowd.

Gor piped up. "If you haven't gone before, Shooter's a real gem. Oh, forgot to ask! Would you like to walk this out as-is or would you prefer I bagged it to-go?"

"To-go, please!" Benny laughed. "The look on his face when I pull this thing out..."

He produced a comically small bag from the register and put over a bedpost. But then he kept tugging, and the bed seemed to scrunch down to fit the space it was given. Imagine shoving an elephant through a mousehole, only instead of a mess you end up with a really, hilariously tiny elephant that can grow back up whenever it would be funny.

He handed the now regular-sized bag over the counter. "_Please_ take pictures!"

"Fenton would kill me." He laughed. We shook hands and then walked back out into the night.

We walked without talking for a block or two, mostly lost in the world around us. The rooftop bar had moved onto a lip sync battle between a giant robot and a tiny godzilla. A dozen different bars, all dotted with toons who looked just like us - invited us to join them, with pub games like "live horseshoes and hand grenades" and "Rabbit Season/Duck Season." I could easily have excused myself right there, ducked into a pub, and drank until the man went to sleep--

"Penny for your thoughts?"

I looked to Benny. His ears laid flat against his head, eyes wide with concern. If his face could talk, its words would be clear. "Stop hiding from your friend."

"I'm scared."

"It took years to find a group I felt safe in, and now that I found it, I'm super happy! It feels good to be stable with you two, and I'm still super happy we have this house together."

They even managed to smile for a moment.

"But?"

"But now, I'm changing, and that scares the shit out of me. It's not just the change itself—it's everything it might mean. What if I lose the parts of me that feel familiar? What if Valerie sees me differently, or worse, doesn't see me at all? It feels like I'm walking into a fog with no way to tell what's on the other side, and I don't know if I'm ready for what I'll find."

They stared off into the distance.

"I can tell, you know."

"What?"

"Val doesn't like this," I said, pointing to my body. "Well, the body I'm going to have next month, I mean. She doesn't say anything about it, but we've been together for years now. I know when something bothers her."

"We're bad at hiding those feelings, I think." he stretched his arm around me and squeezed me tight. "It comes with the territory of being all fuzzy and funny all the time."

"Speak for yourself," I said. "Ever since I figured out I wasn't a girl--"

"Yeah?"

They trailed off. "Sorry. It's weird to talk about with someone who hasn't felt it before."

"I understand. But I'm ready to talk whenever you are, okay?"

"Of course. I promise I will."

We turned the corner and finished the walk in relative silence, if for nothing else than to savor the sounds and sights and smells of toons having the time of their lives for just a moment longer. To pretend to be as happy and carefree as those partygoers were, before we had to face up to old scars in a packed-up house.

# 1.10:

# Benny
We came home to laughter, of all things. It carried down the block, loud and unapologetic. At first, I thought it had to be screaming. I dropped the bag and broke into a run, my steps quickening until they turned into a frantic, almost feral hop. But then the laughter settled, and I caught snatches of a clear, clever, fun-loving voice echoing inside the house.

“It’s my second convention with these people, right? I’m sharing a room with Reverend Lovejoy, this stiff-jawed old coot who—”

“The socks!” Fenton shouted, barely containing his laughter.

“Yes, exactly. The socks guy!”

As I reached the stoop, the voice continued.

“So I walk into the room without knocking—because, of course, he’s a man of the cloth, you know? What’s he gonna do? But I open the door, and there’s Reverend Lovejoy, dick-deep in a toon duck’s bill. He was already too close to stop, so we just _made eye contact_ as he blew his load in that duck’s mouth. And the only thing I can think to say is, ‘Are you quackers, Reverend? At least get a few drinks on their bill first!’”

Wait a second. Reverend Lovejoy? _The socks guy?_

I opened the door to a scene of chaos. Clover and Daniel were sprawled on the couch, clutching their stomachs and wheezing with laughter. The Euchre game lay forgotten. The champagne bottle was empty.

_Even Fenton was laughing._

My foxy man leaned back in his chair, tilting so far it was a miracle he didn’t tip over. He grinned at me, upside down. “Oh, the bed guys are here!”

Clover gave a lazy wave, her head resting on Daniel’s shoulder. Her posture was loose, almost too familiar, like a cat soaking in a sunbeam. Must have been the champagne buzz. “Bed guys! Hi! Just in time. Us old folks are about to turn into pumpkins.”

“Bed’s outside,” I said, lying. “Fox, Val, give Ky a hand?”

They didn’t ask questions. Fenton kissed my cheek as he passed. “Explain it later,” he whispered, skipping—_skipping_—out the door.

I turned back to the room, forcing my voice to stay calm. “So. Y’all were laughing just now?”

Daniel wiped a tear from his eye. “Just reminiscing about my life in politics.”

“You met Socks?” I laughed, the name catching me off guard. “Oh my _god,_ Socks is a _legend_ in our community!”

Clover tilted her head, her hair flipping over onto Daniel’s chest with a soft _fump._ “Wait. Do you mean _the_ Socks guy?”

“No...”

“_Socks the Duck!_ ” Daniel and I said in unison, before bursting into another round of laughter. It felt _wrong_ somehow, but there were worse things that could happen than Socks the Duck becoming the great unifier of this house.

“I’m still lost,” Clover said.

“Socks is a legend in the toon world,” I explained. “He made it his mission to seduce as many Realists as he could, collected evidence against them, and dropped it all on the media in one glorious exposé. Reverend Lovejoy was his biggest catch.”

“He even changed his name to mock him!” Daniel added.

Clover’s eyebrows shot up. “Wait, you’re saying he legally changed his name to... Socks?”

“If you hooked one of the most infamous enemies of your community, wouldn’t you want to take credit forever?”

Daniel grinned. “I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t thought about it.”

“He was a bit of a homewrecker, though,” I admitted. “Loved those big public gags. His boyfriend wasn’t into it. We kinda fell out of touch after that.”

Daniel brightened. “Funny story. I kept in touch with Socks. Turns out, walking in on a guy while he's ducking is a weirdly bonding experience. We'd share tea over the phone, laugh about how silly this whole culture war was, at the heart. We never traded real names, but we sent Christmas cards. He’s even got a family now—cleaned up, mostly. Lives in a toon city near Seattle.”

“No shit.”

“People change,” Daniel said with a shrug. “Honestly, bless him.”

I stared at Daniel, my mind racing. I’d known Socks for years—the sly smirk on his beak, the way he cackled over the phone at 3 a.m. as he plotted some harebrained scheme, or the rare nights he crashed on my couch, feathers ruffled and vulnerable, needing someone to listen. Even the smell of his tobacco-laced cologne felt vivid now. And yet, this man before me, Daniel, who seemed to know Socks as deeply as I did, had never once come up in all those shared moments. I’d thought I knew everything about him.

So why hadn’t he _ever_ mentioned Daniel?

“I’m sorry,” I said, shaking my head. “This is just... _you knew Socks?_”

Daniel shrugged. “I'm more than my activism, Benny. And besides, yo wouldn't know if your husband hadn't got me drunk. Doesn’t take much nowadays. What were you expecting, Benny? A stick in the mud?”

His eyes narrowed ever-so-slightly. _This asshole called my bluff._

“Come on, Benny. You’ve gotta have some stories of your own from your organizing days.”

I hesitated, his easy grin faltering. “Well... there was this civet, I guess...” I felt my face shift, my whole body going stiff as I got lost in memory. I recognized that look. I’d heard Fenton wake up screaming about it on those nights when the nightmares came, when he’d wake up crying from memories he could barely articulate--

“Actually, never mind,” Daniel said abruptly. He took his cane in one hand and slowly, deliberately pulled himself to standing. “The bed should be here soon.”

“Another time, then,” I said gently.

“Perhaps.” He looked to Clover and offered a hand. "So, where are we sleeping?"

Just then, the door opened. Fenton and Val came in, grinning, lugging a super-heavy bag. A bedknob poked out of the top, singing some ridiculous tune. Fenton set it down with a wink.

"You can take it downstairs," Fenton said, laughing. "This thing is heavy when it's not fully in the bag!"

I looked to the stairwell. "We have a little garden apartment downstairs. It's pretty bare right now, but it's something."

"I hope you don't mind me staying too," Clover said. "A cab would cost a fortune at this hour, and honestly, I've a bit too much champagne myself."

"Of course." I looked to the heavy bag in my hand. "I'll need to run out and get another bed, then."

"Oh, we're two old people. No hanky-panky's going to go on." She looked to Daniel with a wan smile. "That is, if the gentleman is okay sharing with the future-live-in mother-in-law."

"I think I can manage," Daniel said with a soft smile.

Before I could let my emotions get the best of me, I set up the bed downstairs. As I passed Fenton in the stairwell I asked him what had happened.

"I always told you," Fenton said. "He's a decent guy, if you look past the whole 'I-hate-toons' thing. Much as I hate to admit it."

"I still worry for you," Benny said.

Fenton kissed me on the nose. "Stop worrying, silly bunny. I'm not that kid anymore. He's in our house, so he follows our rules. And if he gets out of hand, well."

"We throw him out?"

Fenton let out an exasperated sigh. "Benny, it's just one night."

As the laughter and conversation dwindled in the living room, I trudged to the garden apartment in a daze. Socks. Daniel. Even Fenton’s carefree attitude. None of it made sense, and all of it made too much sense at once. Questions churned in my mind, tangled and slippery, as if the pieces didn’t want to fit together just yet. I couldn’t tell if I was furious, amused, or simply exhausted.

I pulled the bed from the bag and it sprang into place in Clover's future bedroom. We'd talked about taking her in for a few weeks; I just didn't realize it was going to be a full-on "surprise, your friend's mother-in-law is now a part of your life, and she's another toon to boot!"

And now, _Daniel Cobbler_?

The bed creaked as I sat on it, the stiffness of the mattress grounding me momentarily. Staring at the dimly lit ceiling, I tried to find clarity, but the thoughts only spun faster. Sleep, I hoped, would make sense of it all by morning. The bed creaked as I laid it out. The bedposts began to sing "Company":

> Phone rings
> Door chimes
> In comes company!
> No strings
> Good times
> Room hums, company!

"Please," I said, covering the post to muffle the words. "Not you too."

I took in as much of the quiet as I could, hoping the space would let my emotions fall. But every few minutes I'd hear him upstairs, all smiles and laughter, _getting off scot free for ruining Fenton's childhood_.

I didn't say a word when I came back up the stairwell. Laughter and conversation echoed off the walls, but I trudged straight up the stairs to our bedroom, where, thank the heavens, Daniel couldn't chase me with his small talk and his annoyingly charming smile.
